I have added an array with white listed domains, and i have added a list of blacklisted characters. 
I thought that i should control what kind of characters the user is allowed to use. I could have added more chars or symbols to the list. 

Likewise im telling the script that it should only run the nslookup script if the domains ends on .dk or .com. 
Those domains I condsider safe and therefore making sure only to ping domains i trust. 

In the code i check the input for my blacklisted chars and if it returns true the script terminates. 
Otherwise it moves on and i check the domain for my whitelisted domains.
